# Horiseon-Website
## User Story
The user wanted me to add more accessibility to the website. Specifically adding alt attributes to images. I also refactored some code to meet up with convention standards
making the code more understandable and less prone to errors when more complex functionality is added. All changes to the code have been marked with comments to cleary
point out what has been changed and why.

## Here is the website to a person with a screen reader with the added accessibility. And of course the default look of the website is the exact same.
